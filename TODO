- Look at hotwash minutes, update outline as needed
- Make a more detailed each day outline
- Add video links, code, to each day's outline
- Make a VM for mini-competitions
- Maybe make a quick and dirty scoring engine for VM's

- Find a place other than github to store VM images.
- Try to keep github download small (mainly text, links, code, and pdf's)
